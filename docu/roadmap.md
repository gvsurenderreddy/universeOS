The universeOS Development Roadmap
----------------------------------

Security
----------
We try to get the script as secure as possible. It is important to point out the most important things we need to take care of:
    1. Javascript Cryptography
    2. A good Cryptoprotocoll which allows
        A Public Key Infrastructure
        Instant Messaging (with Groups)
        An easy exchange of algorithms
    3. Well written and well documented code


Advertising
------------
We think that the universeOS should not be a comerical project. But we also now, that we are trying to compete with services which gather personal data and which can generete enourmous profits with personalized advertising services. I think we should look for ways of advertising methods, which are working without personalized data. (Nic)
